# Implementation Plan v2 for Model Information Persistence and Display

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement model information persistence and display in the task history view. The goal is to ensure that model details are accurately tracked and displayed for each task and message, with proper handling of model changes during conversations.

## Implementation Order

### 1. Message-level Model Tracking ✓
- **Complexity:** Moderate
- **Objective:** Track model information at the message level through API request info.
- **Steps:**
  - Use `ClineApiReqInfo` in message text to store model information
  - Ensure model info is included when creating/saving messages
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing messages
- **Status:** Complete
  - Implemented through `ClineApiReqInfo` in message text
  - Model info stored in `api_req_started` messages
  - Preserves model information across sessions

### 2. Conversation-level Model Tracking
- **Complexity:** High
- **Objective:** Track and manage model changes during active conversations.
- **Steps:**
  - Implement conversation state management for model tracking
  - Create a mechanism to track model changes and transitions
  - Associate model information with message ranges
  - Handle model switching during conversations
- **Considerations:**
  - Need to track when models change within a conversation
  - Must maintain active model state
  - Should support mapping models to message ranges
  - Must handle interruptions and resumptions

### 3. Enhanced History Item Storage
- **Complexity:** Moderate
- **Objective:** Persist conversation model state in history items.
- **Steps:**
  - Update `HistoryItem` to store complete model state:
    ```typescript
    interface HistoryItem {
      // Existing fields
      modelChanges?: {
        modelId: string
        modelProvider: string
        messageRange: [number, number] // timestamps
      }[]
    }
    ```
  - Modify history creation to capture conversation state
  - Update StaticModelIdentifier to:
    1. Use conversation state for active conversations
    2. Use history item state for completed conversations
- **Considerations:**
  - Must preserve model change history
  - Should handle both single-model and multi-model conversations
  - Need to maintain backward compatibility

## Component Interactions

```

                        └──────────────────┘         │    History   │
                                                    └──────────────┘
                                                           │
                                                           ▼
                                                    ┌──────────────┐
                                                    │StaticModel   │
                                                    │Identifier    │
                                                    └──────────────┘
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Conversation State Management**
   - Implement model tracking in conversation state
   - Handle model transitions and changes
   - Maintain message-to-model mapping

2. **History Integration**
   - Store complete model history
   - Support querying model state at any point
   - Handle conversation resumption

3. **UI Updates**
   - Enhance StaticModelIdentifier for both active and historical states
   - Ensure smooth transitions during model switches
   - Maintain performance with larger histories

## Potential Complexities

- **State Management:** Handling complex model change scenarios
- **Performance:** Managing model history without impacting load times
- **UI Consistency:** Ensuring smooth updates during model changes
- **Interruption Handling:** Maintaining state during task interruptions

## Moving Forward

This revised implementation order ensures that:
1. Message-level tracking provides the foundation
2. Conversation-level tracking handles active state
3. History storage preserves the complete model context

This approach will create a more robust system for tracking and displaying model information throughout the conversation lifecycle.
