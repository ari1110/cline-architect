# Implementation Plan for Model Information Persistence and Display

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement model information persistence and display in the task history view. The goal is to ensure that model details are accurately tracked and displayed for each task and message.

## Implementation Order

### 1. Message-level Model Tracking
- **Complexity:** Moderate
- **Objective:** Attach model information directly to each message to ensure persistence across task sessions.
- **Steps:**
  - Modify the `ClineMessage` type to include `modelId` and `modelProvider`.
  - Update the methods responsible for creating and saving messages to include model information.
  - Ensure that when messages are loaded from history, the model information is preserved.
- **Considerations:** 
  - Ensuring backward compatibility with existing messages.

### 2. Enhanced History Item Storage
- **Complexity:** Low to Moderate
- **Objective:** Store detailed model information in the `HistoryItem` to facilitate retrieval and display.
- **Steps:**
  - Update the `HistoryItem` type to include fields for `modelId` and `modelProvider`.
  - Modify the task history creation process to capture and store model information.
  - Ensure that the history view retrieves and displays this information correctly.
- **Considerations:**
  - Ensuring the history view can access and display model information.

### 3. Conversation-level Model Tracking
- **Complexity:** High
- **Objective:** Maintain model information at the conversation level to associate it with specific messages.
- **Steps:**
  - Implement a mechanism to track model changes during a conversation.
  - Store model information in a way that allows it to be associated with individual messages.
  - Ensure that when revisiting a task, the correct model information is displayed.
- **Considerations:**
  - Implementing a mechanism to track model changes.

## Potential Complexities

- **Data Migration:** Ensuring backward compatibility with existing data structures.
- **UI Updates:** Modifying the UI to display model information without cluttering the interface.
- **Performance:** Ensuring that the additional data does not impact performance, especially when loading large histories.

## Moving Forward

Given the constraints of updating past tasks, this implementation will focus on ensuring that new tasks and messages have accurate model information. This approach will provide a robust solution for tracking and displaying model details in future interactions.
